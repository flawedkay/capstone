THIS IS THE FRONTEND INTERFACE FOR LOCALE, a developer tool for anyone who needs to know Nigeria, geographically at least. Locale’s API shows you all of Nigeria’s regions, states, and local government areas(LGAs). Locale is looking to be a very useful tool for the thousands of businesses building for Nigeria’s 200M+ population size. 


– Search: Locale allows developers to search for information about Nigeria based on the following categories; region, state, and local government area(LGAs). It is possible that developers would want to search for a region with the states under them but not the local government. This also applies to states with LGAs. Locale should also return all metadata associated with each region, state, or LGA on search.
